            <h2>JCA - Who?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    My name is Joan Castells Appriou, and I mainly work as writer first, artist second.<br>
                    My whole career has been focused on honing my skill to work on narrative spaces, breathing life into stories and characters 
                    filling them with identity, color and energy. I specialize on fantastic settings, and as you can see below I have developed 
                    extensive amounts of writing for a personal universe as well as for collaborative projects at Game Jams and in videogame 
                    development.

            <div>
                <p>
                    As a teenager I was deeply fascinated by fantasy universes, such as Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere or Bethesda's Tamriel, and 
                    shortly started developing a taste for telling personal stories through passionately crafted characters in pop culture 
                    universes. This eventually left me with a hunger for more as I started distorting beloved stories and universes of my reading 
                    and playing, eager to build a strong setting for my own stories.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Since then, I have shown my prowess in imagination, designing settings and characters through my works during my time at uni, 
                    together with friends and coworkers.

            <div>
                <p>
                    As an artist, my work experience is slightly lesser. I have focused on harnessing my imagination as a tool for visual arts, mainly 
                    working as a concept artist, in character and environment design, also illustrating props and adapting to different artstyles if 
                    needed.

            <h2>The Deal with Ad'Arun</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Ad'Arun is the (provisional though very established) name for my personally developed universe.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    It is the grand space where worlds you may be more familiar with such as Karemor are located. It exists as a flexible and expansive 
                    playground for my personal shenanigans, and the narratives that I like to develop as long-term projects. Ad'Arun is the house of 
                    my hope, and has carried me through harsh times in my life. The amount of time and passion that has gone into its development is 
                    untold, uncounted.

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Ad'Arun is a universe full of strange rules and exceptions that break them. There, stories about mad gods, petty civilizations, 
                    immortal anti-heroes or vengeful splinters of conscious power find their way through it all, seeking to flourish. Worlds that 
                    unmake and remake themselves, strangely shaped planets with two suns that defy the laws of physics, rotting corpses of once 
                    sprawling stars, all-encompassing singularities where the fate of galaxies are decided upon, and many such wonders wait to be 
                    discovered.

                    If you would be interested in learning more about this universe and its intricacies, you are welcome to take a look at its official 
                    website, along with the wealth of articles that dabble in the details of Ad'Arun.

            <h2>Artistic Education</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I have been educated in artistic matters for several years, including a high school diploma in arts. I focus in traditional artistic 
                    expression, painting and drawing, but I am also relatively proficient in digital art, having worked with Photoshop and Clip Studio to 
                    develop projects. I also have experience in 3D modeling and animation, having worked with Blender and Unity for game development.

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    My artstyle is heavily influenced by the works of artists such as Yoshitaka Amano, Moebius, and the art of the Final Fantasy series. I 
                    have a preference for detailed and intricate designs, and I am particularly fond of working with character design and environment 
                    design. I have also worked with prop design and illustration, and I am open to adapting to different artstyles if needed.

                <p>
                    I have worked as a concept artist for several projects, including videogames and tabletop games, and I have also worked as an 
                    illustrator and graphic designer for several projects specifying in logos and graphic user interface.

                    I am also experienced in photography and direction in audiovisual productions, having worked as a photographer and scriptwriter.
